- Provides `rank_resume()` method
- Returns score (0-10) and qualitative rank
- Handles model inference and scoring logic

#### 3. Resume Parser (`backend/utils/parser.py`)
- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts text from PDF files using PyPDF2
- **Text File Parsing**: Reads plain text resume files
- **Skill Extraction**: Regex-based identification of technical skills
- **Experience Extraction**: Pattern matching for years of experience

#### 4. Flask API Server (`backend/app.py`)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/rank-resume`: File upload and analysis
  - `GET /api/statistics`: Usage statistics
  - `GET /api/history`: Analysis history (last 10 entries)
  - `GET /api/templates`: Resume templates for testing
- **CORS Enabled**: Supports cross-origin requests from frontend
- **File Handling**: Secure temporary file processing
- **In-Memory Storage**: Statistics and history tracking

#### 5. Web Interface (`frontend/index.html`)
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Analyze, Templates, Statistics, History
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface with validation
- **Real-time Results**: Dynamic display of analysis results
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout
- **Professional UI**: Gradient backgrounds and modern styling

## Implementation Details

### Machine Learning Model Training

```python
# Text vectorization with TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000, stop_words='english')
X_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X)

# Linear regression for score prediction
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### Resume Analysis Pipeline

1. **File Reception**: Accept PDF or text file upload
2. **Text Extraction**: Parse file content to plain text
3. **Feature Engineering**: Convert text to TF-IDF vectors
4. **Model Inference**: Predict resume score using trained model
5. **Information Extraction**: Identify skills and experience
6. **Result Compilation**: Package score, rank, and metadata
7. **Response Generation**: Return JSON response to frontend

### API Design

```json
// Rank Resume Response
{
  "filename": "resume.pdf",
  "score": 8.5,
  "rank": "Excellent",
  "skills": ["python", "javascript", "aws"],
  "experience_years": 5
}
```

## Data Flow

1. **User uploads resume** → Frontend captures file
2. **Frontend sends POST request** → Backend receives file
3. **Backend parses file** → Extracts text content
4. **Parser analyzes content** → Identifies skills and experience
5. **Ranker processes text** → ML model predicts score
6. **Backend compiles results** → Updates statistics and history
7. **Frontend displays results** → User sees analysis

## Testing and Validation

### Test Cases
- **Resume 1**: Software Engineer profile (Expected: High score ~8-9)
- **Resume 2**: Data Scientist profile (Expected: High score ~8-9)
- **Templates**: Pre-built resumes for consistent testing

### Model Performance
- **Training MSE**: 0.4 (acceptable for regression task)
- **Feature Count**: 1000 TF-IDF features
- **Score Range**: 0-10 (clamped for realistic bounds)

## Usage Instructions

### Setup
1. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Train ML model: `cd ml && python train_model.py`
3. Start backend server: `cd backend && python app.py`
4. Open frontend: Open `frontend/index.html` in web browser

### Operation
1. Navigate to "Analyze Resume" tab
2. Upload PDF/TXT file or paste resume text
3. Click "Analyze Resume" button
4. View results: score, rank, skills found, experience
5. Explore other tabs: Templates, Statistics, History

## Challenges and Solutions

### Technical Challenges
1. **PDF Text Extraction**: Solved with PyPDF2 library
2. **CORS Issues**: Implemented flask-cors middleware
3. **File Upload Security**: Used temporary files with proper cleanup
4. **Model Persistence**: Used joblib for efficient serialization

### Design Challenges
1. **Responsive UI**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for mobile compatibility
2. **User Experience**: Drag-and-drop file upload with visual feedback
3. **Real-time Feedback**: Loading states and error handling
